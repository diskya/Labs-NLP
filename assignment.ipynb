    "# [COM6513] Assignment: Topic Classification with a Feedforward Network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructor: Nikos Aletras\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to develop a Feedforward neural network for topic classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose, you will implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text processing methods for transforming raw text data into input vectors for your network  (**1 mark**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Feedforward network consisting of:\n",
    "    - **One-hot** input layer mapping words into an **Embedding weight matrix** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **One hidden layer** computing the mean embedding vector of all words in input followed by a **ReLU activation function** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **Output layer** with a **softmax** activation. (**1 mark**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with **back-propagation** to learn the weights of your Neural network. Your algorithm should:\n",
    "    - Use (and minimise) the **Categorical Cross-entropy loss** function (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Forward pass** to compute intermediate outputs (**2 marks**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Backward pass** to compute gradients and update all sets of weights (**3 marks**)\n",
    "    - Implement and use **Dropout** after each hidden layer for regularisation (**1 marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss how did you choose hyperparameters? You can tune the learning rate (hint: choose small values), embedding size {e.g. 50, 300, 500} and the dropout rate {e.g. 0.2, 0.5}. Please use tables or graphs to show training and validation performance for each hyperparameter combination  (**2 marks**). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- After training a model, plot the learning process (i.e. training and validation loss in each epoch) using a line plot and report accuracy. Does your model overfit, underfit or is about right? (**1 mark**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-train your network by using pre-trained embeddings ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) trained on large corpora. Instead of randomly initialising the embedding weights matrix, you should initialise it with the pre-trained weights. During training, you should not update them (i.e. weight freezing) and backprop should stop before computing gradients for updating embedding weights. Report results by performing hyperparameter tuning and plotting the learning process. Do you get better performance? (**1 marks**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend you Feedforward network by adding more hidden layers (e.g. one more or two). How does it affect the performance? Note: You need to repeat hyperparameter tuning, but the number of combinations grows exponentially. Therefore, you need to choose a subset of all possible combinations (**3 marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide well documented and commented code describing all of your choices. In general, you are free to make decisions about text processing (e.g. punctuation, numbers, vocabulary size) and hyperparameter values. We expect to see justifications and discussion for all of your choices. You must provide detailed explanations of your implementation, provide a detailed analysis of the results (e.g. why a model performs better than other models etc.) including error analyses (e.g. examples and discussion/analysis of missclasifications etc.)  (**10 marks**). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide efficient solutions by using Numpy arrays when possible. Executing the whole notebook with your code should not take more than 10 minutes on any standard computer (e.g. Intel Core i5 CPU, 8 or 16GB RAM) excluding hyperparameter tuning runs and loading the pretrained vectors. You can find tips in Lab 1 (**2 marks**). \n",

    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use for the task is a subset of the [AG News Corpus](http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html) and you can find it in the `./data_topic` folder in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_topic/train.csv`: contains 2,400 news articles, 800 for each class to be used for training.\n",
    "- `data_topic/dev.csv`: contains 150 news articles, 50 for each class to be used for hyperparameter selection and monitoring the training process.\n",
    "- `data_topic/test.csv`: contains 900 news articles, 300 for each class to be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class 1: Politics, Class 2: Sports, Class 3: Economy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-trained Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download pre-trained GloVe embeddings trained on Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download) from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip). No need to unzip, the file is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "To save RAM, when you finish each experiment you can delete the weights of your network using `del W` followed by Python's garbage collector `gc.collect()`\n",

    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** submit a Jupyter Notebook file (assignment_yourusername.ipynb) and an exported PDF version (you can do it from Jupyter: `File->Download as->PDF via Latex`, you need to have a Latex distribution installed e.g. MikTex or MacTex and pandoc). If you are unable to export the pdf via Latex, you can print the notebook web page to a pdf file from your browser (e.g. on Firefox: File->Print->Save to PDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to follow the code structure given in this notebook by completing all given funtions. You can also write any auxilliary/helper functions (and arguments for the functions) that you might need but note that you can provide a full solution without any such functions. Similarly, you can just use only the packages imported below but you are free to use any functionality from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), NumPy, SciPy (excluding built-in softmax funtcions) and Pandas. You are **not allowed to use any third-party library** such as Scikit-learn (apart from metric functions already provided), NLTK, Spacy, Keras, Pytorch etc.. You should mention if you've used Windows to write and test your code because we mostly use Unix based machines for marking (e.g. Ubuntu, MacOS). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single correct answer on what your accuracy should be, but correct implementations usually achieve F1-scores around 80\\% or higher. The quality of the analysis of the results and discussion is as important as the implementation and accuracy of your models. Please be brief and consice in your discussion and analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be marked out of 30. It is worth 30\\% of your final grade in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for this assignment is **23:59 on Mon, 12 Apr 2024** and it needs to be submitted via Blackboard. Standard departmental penalties for lateness will be applied. We use a range of strategies to **detect [unfair means](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/unfair-means/index)**, including Turnitin which helps detect plagiarism. Use of unfair means would result in getting a failing grade.\n",

Here the grid research for parameter will be chose to find the best hyperparameters. We used 0.005 and 0.05 for 2 times gap which can be used to find best value caused keeping the cure smooth and dont apper overfitting is fine, large learing rate may prevent  to get the best point which has lowest loss.\n",

However this may also have significant increase on the complexity. That may be the reason that we failed to have a large optimisation on grid search.\n",
